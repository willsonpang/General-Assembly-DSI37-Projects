## Background
The COVID19 pandemic acted as a catalyst that allow of rthe huge influx of retail investors into the market. This then snowballed into the meme stock phenomenon where the retail investors are able to organized themselves and drive up the price of certain stocks (which are now dubbed as meme stocks). The most famous case that most people heard of is the case of GME where a community of retail investors from this subreddit called r/wallstreetbets were able to coordinate a short squeeze and drive a hedge fund, Melvin Capital into massive losses. Melvin Capital has since then been closed down. 

This shows that the retail investors are big enough that they have power to a certain extent to influence the market. Insitution investors can now no longer ignore their retail investors counterpart and would have to take into account the sentiment of the retail investors when making investment decisions.

## Data Preprocessing

Data cleaning was performed to both the scraped reddit data and the historical stock price data, checks such as checking for null values, checking for duplicates, removing some symbols in the certain cells, changing the data type to the appropriate ones to fascillitate the modelling process.



## Modeling

Following the data preprocessing stage, the preprocessed dataset was fed into various models such as Regression models, Random Forest, ARIMA, Naive Forecaster, fbprophet, etc. The model that performs the best in terms of r-squared and MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) was then selected as the final model that is used for the forecast of the stock price.
